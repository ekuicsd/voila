                        Voila is an online platform for travelers seeking to engage with locals all over the world to offer them the most outstanding eat experiences, tours and activities. We are a marketplace where demand (travelers) meets supply (local hosts).

Through our website, travelers can book experiences, tours and activities with local hosts all over the world.

By making a reservation through our platform, guests enter into a direct contractual relationship with the host with whom they make a reservation. From the point when the booking is made, Voila acts solely as an intermediary between the guest and the host. Voila is not a party to any agreement between the guest and the host and is not liable for any (attributable) failure to perform or other damages arising out of this relationship
